Translation Progress (autogenerated)

The counting is done in both lines and bytes. Bytes might be the best as it avoids the error caused by short and long lines. Common for both is that they only count actual onscreen text. This excludes untranslateable lines in the script like control for sprites and bgm. Unreviewed lines are made by people on HongFire, who has left long ago. Quality varies greatly and some, but certainly not all, can be used.

Common route:
Lines: 90.277%
