# This file contains the setup of optional features included in the translation.
# options are enabled and disabled by assigning numbers
# 0 = disabled
# 1 = enabled
# setting a disable feature to 1 will enable the disable condition.
# This mean setting disable_screen_flash to 1 will remove the flashes while
# setting it to 0 will make the game flash

# the default values for all settings are 0.
# The default conditions are the ones closest to the original game.


# disable white flashing screens.
# They are best known for climax at H scenes, though they can also be used elsewhere.
# This will only disable the common way the game script makes the screen flash.
# Nobody knows if it flashes elsewhere using different script commands.
# Do not read this as "flash free game" if you have a medical reason to avoid flashes.
