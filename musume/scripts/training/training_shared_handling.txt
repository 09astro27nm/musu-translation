# New file for translation patch

# The goal is to gather all stat gains and losses for training in one file to get an overview and make the girls more consistent.

# Usage guide:
# Once a girl finish activity (each activity, not a whole training session), the counter for the activity is increased by one
# Next activity_count= whatever that counter increased to
# then goto/gosub training_stat_handle_* where * is the activity in question. Remember this file ends with a return, meaning goto would be the same as gosub; return

# training_stat_handle_* should set
# gain_karada, gain_kokoro, gain_miryoku, loss_tairyoku, loss_seishin
# As a regeral rule, the resulting gain/loss would be those numbers multiplied by activity_count, but modifiers might apply
# after that goto training_stat_update_bars
